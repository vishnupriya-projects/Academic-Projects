# PROJECT TITLE: Identification of critical success factors to improve the overall performance of MSMEs - A Empirical study of food processing industries around Delhi NCR.

## OBJECTIVE: 
1. Identifying the critical success variables through literature review & these factors are analyzed by an empirical survey of particular area food processing industries.
2. To study the demographic profiles of responses from various food processing industries.
3. To prioritize the critical success variables which help improve an MSME's performance and success.
4. Through quantitative data, Critical success factors were evaluated using Exploratory factor analysis to find whether the identified key success variables represent the critical success factor & correlation between variables. 

## SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:
The study identifies critical success factors through literature review and empirical survey. The critical success factors required for food processing industries, especially MSMEs, were identified & prioritized, which helps food organizations the key areas to be focused on to improve overall success and business performance.

## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
- This study is empirical research, in which the variables are identified through a literature review followed by experts' opinions in food processing industries.
- The identified variables are quantitatively measured using the data collected from various industry experts currently working in the food processing industries.
Based on above methodology the following things are done.

1. Through secondary research, total 21 variables were identified which are useful for research. Based on these 21 variables a questionnaire is prepared. 
2. The questionnaire is circulated to over 300 responses via direct Email, messages to particular responses & social media. A total of 105 responses were received from various food industry professionals working in & around the Delhi-NCR region. The sample size taken for this study is 105 responses, with a response rate of 21%.
   
## DATA ANALYSIS
The analysis of data is carried out in three stages. 
1. In the first stage, the demographic profiles of the responses are carried out. 
2. In the second stage, the data is analyzed to check the reliability of the data by using Cronbach's reliability test. Then the data undergoes descriptive statistics to find the mean and standard deviation of variables based on the responses received. Based on the mean values, critical success variables will be prioritized, and ranking key success variables will help areas that need to be focused more. 
3. In the third stage, the data is analyzed using Exploratory Factor Analysis to find the credibility and validity of the success factors. The EFA technique is used to reduce the variables into significant factors based on the correlation between the factors & variables. To find the appropriateness of the data, Bartlett's test of sphericity & the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) is used in which Bartlett's test of sphericity is used to measure whether the variables are correlated to each other. This EFA analysis helps to represent the identified variables into groups that represent a factor, and these factors can further be analyzed as an independent variable.
All the analysis were carried out in IBM SPSS software.

## Insights & Conclusions
- This study's identification of critical success factors helps to identify the key success variables, which are important areas to focus on by the MSMEs to improve the overall business performance. This study reveals that customer satisfaction is most important for the success of an organization, followed by maintaining the quality of products & marketing. Most of the responses them belong to the quality department.
- The variables are prioritized, which explains the key areas to be focused on by the micro, small & medium food industries. The variables are further reduced to influential factors such as internal & external business factors with a variance of 72%, which represents the entire variables.
- In demographic factors, the majority of responses belong to the quality department and are working in dairy & RTE/RTS-based food industries which makes the study confined to consumer-based food industries.
- Most customers believe that customer satisfaction is most important, followed by maintaining the quality of products as are a priority for the success of the organization. Company restructuring represents the least priority among all key success variables.
- Among all the variables, Employee training & education shows the highest factor loading of 0.842, which represents a good correlation coefficient between variable & factor. The factor loadings > 0.70 represents good correlation coefficients between variable & factor.
- Here, variables such as Top management commitment, employee commitment, Employees training & education, performance appraisal & compensation, total quality management, continuous improvement, Implementation of HACCP/ISO/FSMS standards, maintaining the quality of product, and proper business plan have strong correlation with one factor, i.e., internal business factor & company restructuring, research & development, adoption of technologies, government support & polices social responsibilities, sustainable practices are showing strong correlation with another factor, i.e., external business factor.
- Most of the respondents (71%) believe that sales, profit of the business, overall efficiency & customer satisfaction are very important to measure the success of an organization.
- Few responses also gave suggestions on things to be required to improve the performance of organization such as proper communication with customers & branding of the product is important, conducting training & sessions for employee's skill improvements, few sessions on work-life balance, Physical & mental health being, work satisfaction of employees in the organization is also contributes to the success of an organization.

#### Further study:
- In this study, the data gathered from a particular region, and the opinion of responses may vary from region to region. The key success variables are identified, which cover the entire organization areas; more variables can be identified & added, which helps to explore more about the factors contributing the success of an organization. 
- Here, the EFA is conducted to identify the factors; further, the Confirmatory factor analysis can also be done, followed by structural equational modeling, in which the identified variables are divided into factors according to departmental wise/ more specific to a particular area which becomes factors called as independent variables. These factors, and independent variables, are further utilized to identify their influence/impact on certain dependent variables like success, growth, or performance of an organization.
- The identified variables can also be prioritized using various techniques like AHP, DEMANTEL approach, etc., which can give a clear idea of which area need to focus more on organization's success. 
- This study can also be done as a case study approach for taking example a a particular organization & identifying variables that help to improve the performance of the current organizations by taking opinions from employees. These industrial experts helps to figure out the exact problems & solutions which need to improve for growth of an organization.
- Not only success factors, but failure factors are equally important to identify which helps organizations, entrepreneurs what are the probable factors causing failure & how to overcome those factors to improve overall organization performance.
- Further studies can also be done for other region-specific responses by considering the variables from a particular departments i.e., for example, the factors that help to improve the performance of quality/operations/supply chain, etc., which specify the variables contributing to particular departmental wise.
- The study can also be done all over India by taking more responses which help to give a clear picture of the opinions of different people working in various food processing industries, which helps to explore more variables that are contributing to the growth of an organization.
